basically, i just made these scripts for fun, and were not intended to be used in any malicious way. The code is open source because obfusicating is literally the stupidest thing ever, 
people act like anyone cares who made what, most of these 7 year old kids on roblox just want to hack, they dont care who made it, they wont bother to look, they just throw it into a malware executor
and go on about their day.

With that, use these for whatever, and do note that im not responsible if you get banned in any way possible whilst using these scripts.

Happy Exploiting!
